#In this SQL I'm querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were made in January?
SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> "Order ID"

#2. How many of those orders were for iPhones?
SELECT count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers c

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales fs
ON c.order_id = fs.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT round(sum(quantity)*price,2) as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, sum(quantity) as total_sold, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.febsales feb
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT distinct count(acctnum), avg(quantity)*price
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales fs
ON c.order_id = fs.orderID
WHERE fs.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
